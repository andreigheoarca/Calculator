# Calculator

My first attempt at coding a calculator with a iOS inspired design, while following the Odin Project curicculum.

## Usage

This is a basic calculator that can provide the user with a result of one of the following mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) between two desired values. 

After the first value is inputted, the user can choose one of the desired opperands, after which, the user can input the second value. The calculator will display the result of the selected operation after the "equal" key is pressed. 

The user can press the "AC"(all clear) key in order to clear any value that is displayed on the screen

The calculator also has the ability to calculate decimal numbers due to using "parseFloat" for each of the provided values.

## Project lookback and future considerations 

Even though I learned the JS fundamentals from various resources, I decided to use The Odin Project as a guideline of sorts for my personal projects so I settled on creating a Javascript calculator for my next project.

As a JS beginner at first it seemed quite a daunting task and initially I couldnâ€™t quite make a mental map of all the moving parts but slowly I as I started tackling the HTML and CSS, the javascript functionality started to make sense.

Just as with my previous JS project, which was a To Do list, I decided to practice selecting elements using event bubbling. 

The challenging part of the project was actually displaying the second value needed for the calculation and storing both values but I successfully used the dataset attribute as a solution. 

The dataset attribute made it ultimately really easy to calculate the final result depending on the chosen operand. 

Currently, the calculator supports two values, with decimals included and with the operands of adding, subtracting, multiplying and division.
